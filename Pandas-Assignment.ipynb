    "# 1.head() and tail(): These functions allow you to view the first few rows (head()) or the last few rows (tail()) of a DataFrame. They are useful for quickly inspecting the structure and contents of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.info(): This function provides a summary of the DataFrame, including the column names, data types, and the number of non-null values. It helps in understanding the data types and identifying missing values in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.describe(): This function generates descriptive statistics of the numerical columns in the DataFrame, such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. It provides a quick overview of the distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4.shape: This attribute returns a tuple representing the dimensions of the DataFrame, i.e., the number of rows and columns. It is useful for obtaining the size of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5.loc[] and iloc[]: These indexing operators allow for label-based (loc[]) and integer-based (iloc[]) selection of rows and columns in the DataFrame. They are used to retrieve specific subsets of data based on row and column labels or indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6.drop(): This function is used to remove rows or columns from the DataFrame. It allows you to specify the labels of the rows or columns you want to drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7.sort_values(): This function sorts the DataFrame based on one or more columns. It is helpful for arranging the data in ascending or descending order based on specific criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8.groupby(): This function is used to group data based on one or more columns. It enables aggregating, transforming, and applying functions to the grouped data, allowing for data summarization and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9.merge(): This function combines two or more DataFrames based on common columns or indices. It is useful for combining related data from different sources into a single DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10.fillna(): This function is used to fill missing values in the DataFrame with a specified value or a strategy like mean, median, or mode. It helps in handling missing data before performing analysis.\n"
